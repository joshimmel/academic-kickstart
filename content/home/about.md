# About me
I am PhD Candidate in the Rodriguez Lab as part of the Earth, Marine, and Environmental Sciences department at the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/). My research explores changes in the earth's surface over timescales we can observe in our own lives; days to years. By tracking the origin and fate of sediments carried by rivers, tides, and storms, I aim to explain why saltmarshes, barrier islands, and oyster reefs reside where do. I enjoy linking datasets across spatial scales — from 10 centimeter wide sediment cores up to 100 kilometer wide satelite images — to help answer these questions. I collaborate with colleagues who use these data to forecast which systems seem stable and which are at risk. If all of that sounds like a lot, just know I make pretty figures.

Beyond research, you might find me [flying a drone](https://beaufortdronephotography.com/), [running or backpacking](https://www.strava.com/athletes/49210500), [cooking with others](https://photos.app.goo.gl/NVNG1qLAGS6ktRUz7), or [teaching hands-on science](https://sixthdegreenorth.wordpress.com/).
